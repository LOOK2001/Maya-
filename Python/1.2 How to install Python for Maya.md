Maya uses Python 2.7

Using Maya Python version instead, Maya Python interpreter is located at where Maya installed (Maya2017\bin\mayapy.exe)

1. Download Maya dev kit. Extract all of these into Maya root directory

2. Add new interpreter path (there are a bunch of parts for Python to use). After that, PyCharm will know to use Maya API instead of System Python and will be able to autocomplete as you type.
